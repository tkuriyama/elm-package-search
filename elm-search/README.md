# Elm UI

The package index data is generated by the [Python code](https://github.com/tkuriyama/elm-package-search/tree/master/python-indexer) into Elm modules (in the `data` directory). 

The Elm UI provides an interface to query the index data with keywords.


## Build

To follow the "full" build for this repo, run the commands in the `all.do` script (`redo all` if you have [`redo`](https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or run it as a shell script like `sh all.do`).


See [this page](https://tkuriyama.github.io/general/2021/04/22/Building-Elm.html) for an explanation of the build steps and dependencies.
